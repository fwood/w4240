Student reviews from past semesters
==========================

Comments on readings, materials, assignments, and examinations
---------------

1. The book is excellent. The assignments in this course were more challenging than any other course I have taken in the past.
2. Really enjoyed the assignments in this class. Excellent job putting them together. 
3. Very difficult programming assignments, and I learned a lot doing them, ... 

What were the best aspects of this course?
----------------
1. Assignments, Professor
2. The homework.
3. The assignments were challenging and probably the best part of the course. It was with bated breath, and nervous anticipation - almost like a blind date with someone you knew would be pretty - that we waited for the homework... ok, maybe that was 10% exaggerated. The final project also was/is very enjoyable. It allowed us to pursue topics of our interest, using cutting edge tools (both taught in the course, and otherwise).

General Comments
----------------
1. Frank may seem intimidating at first, but it is only because he expects a lot from his students. For me, this was motivation to understand the material better before asking for help. He is a nice guy once you get to know him.
