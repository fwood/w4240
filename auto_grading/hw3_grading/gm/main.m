% This main file is used to execute the em algorithm for gaussian mixture
% modeling.  The data is the fisher iris data where each row of data are
% four measurements taken from the pedal of an iris flower.  The value is e
% is a small number to asses convergence of the algorithm.  Whent the
% likelihood of the data under the model ceases to increase by e every time
% the algorithm is assumed to have converged.  Important variables are
% listed below.
%
% data  : data matrix n x d with rows as elements of data
% gamma : a n x k matrix of responsilities.  each row should sum to 1.
% pi    : column vector of probabilities for each class
% param :  mu   : d x k matrix of class centers listed as columns
% sigma : k x 1 cell array of class covariance matrices (each are d x d)
